# Loan_Status

In this dataset,I have tried to predict the status of the loan applied by an applicat i.e. whether the loan will pass or not. This is a classification problem. The dataset contains the columns like Gender of customer, whether the customer is married or not, persons's income, loan amount,Property area etc. I have used different classification techniques like Logistic Regression, decision Tree etc to predict the outcome of the dependent feature.
